This was a challenge, but I give some of my credit to EdenKhaos JS repo. I was having some trouble figuring out how the javascrpict was going to work. 
You have to have some sort of logic or plan on how you want the software to sun on the computer. After countless hours of reserch I tried to use
varibles, nodes. There aren't many people making work hour schedulers these days. When you you working with three languages simotaniously,
the first thing to do is figure out the classes and ids from the HTML and CSS files to even how a clue on how to create JS. 

Javascript is going to take sometime to master and the only way to get better is to keep doing. In my app you'll be able to save what ever you wrote
I understand the code now and how I would go about making color changes through the hour through JavaScript. Its ok to ask for help and do research 
because the answer and solution is out there. 

First thing to is get your HTML and CSS class and ids together
Then for JavaScript we run a ready function this will get the HTMl and CSS ready
Load up the moment.js
I was forcing myself to make the savbtn a varible, when all I needed to was make it an onclick function
var text and time and set its attribute
introduce the local storage to save the text
Now we want call and load the data from the local storage by each hur displayed
Create a hourtracker function to change the colors determine the hour
Loop the timeblocks because you want the app to work daily
Make a code to check to see if it works properply where you add and remove attributes
Then Finally the hourtracker() to keep the cycle going daily.
